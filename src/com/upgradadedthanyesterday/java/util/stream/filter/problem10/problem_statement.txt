Problem statement:
    -   You are given a List of Strings with null, non-null, very long and very short strings.
    -   Your tasks is to find all the non-null and trimmed strings with length greater than 5 and print them. The output should be unique and sorted in natural order.
    -   You can print the output directly or may put into a list and print

Input List:
-------------
List<String> list = Arrays.asList(
                "Java",
                " Spring ",
                null,
                "",
                "Microservices",
                "Java",                // duplicate
                "  Hibernate",
                "Docker  ",
                "  ",
                "Kubernetes",
                null,                  // duplicate null
                "AWS",
                " spring ",            // duplicate (case + spaces variation)
                "DevOps",
                "",
                "React",
                " Angular ",
                "SQL",
                "NoSQL",
                "Java  "               // duplicate with trailing space
        );

Expected Output:
-------------
Angular
DevOps
Docker
